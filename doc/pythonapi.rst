pythonapi -- Python library to read/write DiscoDBs
====================================================================

By default the python API links against libdiscodb at runtime and provides a thin wrapper to the functionality.



Examples
========

incrementally adding key/value pairs to a constructor::

    from discodb import DiscoDBConstructor
